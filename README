=====================     WEAK: Encrypt Anything Known     =====================

#### What is this?
 WEAK encrypts something. This is useful when saving a game or sending a secret
message.

#### How to use it?
 To use it, for the first time, please download this at GitHub available here:
<https://github.com/apple502j/weak> PyPI support will be added soon.

 After getting this, install it via "python3 setup.py install". This will add
this library to the computer. Please make sure to use Python 3.6 or later:
It won't work if the version is less than that, especially for Python 2.x.

 This library has two functions: One to generate a key, the other to actually
encrypt/decrypt something. The first function is generateKeys() which will
return a tuple of the public key and the private key. It will always return
different values. The second function is crypt(text,key). The public key is
needed when decrypting something encrypted via private key; same as private
key. When a wrong key is passed, it will return an exception.

#### Examples

import weak
public,private=weak.generateKeys()
print(public)
print(private)
text=input("What to encrypt?")
encrypted=weak.crypt(text,public)
decrypted=weak.crypt(text,private)
print(encrypted)
print(decrypted)
